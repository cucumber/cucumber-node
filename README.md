  <b>Automated tests in plain language, for the Node.js test runner</b>
</p>

[Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber) is a tool for running automated tests written in plain language. Because they're
written in plain language, they can be read by anyone on your team. Because they can be
read by anyone, you can use them to help improve communication, collaboration and trust on
your team.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is a new implementation of Cucumber built around the [Node.js test runner](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html). It's still in the pre-1.0.0 phase, so APIs and behaviour might change. The stable canonical implementation of Cucumber for JavaScript continues to be [@cucumber/cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) for now. ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Install

cucumber-node is [available on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cucumber/node):

```shell
npm install --save-dev @cucumber/node
```

You'll need Node.js 22 or 23.

## Get started

Say we have this small class:

```js
export class Greeter {
  sayHello() {
    return 'hello'
  }
}
```

Let's write a feature file specifying how it should work, in `features/greeting.feature`:

```gherkin
Feature: Greeting

  Scenario: Say hello
    When the greeter says hello
    Then I should have heard "hello"
```

Next, we need to provide automation to turn that spec into tests, in `features/support/steps.js`:

```js
import assert from 'node:assert'
import { When, Then } from '@cucumber/node'
import { Greeter } from '../../lib/Greeter.js'

When('the greeter says hello', (t) => {
  t.world.whatIHeard = new Greeter().sayHello()
});

Then('I should have heard {string}', (t, expectedResponse) => {
  assert.equal(t.world.whatIHeard, expectedResponse)
});
```

Finally, run `node --test` with some special arguments:

```shell
node --import @cucumber/node/bootstrap --test "features/**/*.feature"
```

## Running tests

Since cucumber-node augments the standard Node.js test runner, you can use many of its options in the same way you would when running tests written in JavaScript, like:

- üîÄ [`--test-concurrency`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--test-concurrency) to control the number of concurrent processes
- üèÉ [`--test-force-exit`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--test-force-exit) to forcibly exit once all tests have executed
- üò∑ [`--test-isolation=none`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--test-isolationmode) to have all tests run in a single process
- üîç [`--test-name-pattern`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--test-name-pattern) to target some scenarios by name
- üíé [`--test-shard`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--test-shard) to shard execution across multiple runs/environments
- ‚è© [`--test-skip-pattern`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--test-skip-pattern) to omit some scenarios by name
- üëÄ [`--watch`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--watch) to watch for changes and automatically re-run

(In all cases you still need the `--import @cucumber/node/bootstrap` so that cucumber-node kicks in when a feature file is encountered.)

## Writing steps

Full API documentation is at https://cucumber.github.io/cucumber-node and includes:

- `Before` and `After` for hooks
- `Given`, `When` and `Then` for steps
- `ParameterType` for custom parameter types
- `DataTable` for working with data tables

### Test context

When you write a step or hook function, the first argument will always be a [`TestCaseContext`](https://cucumber.github.io/cucumber-node/types/TestCaseContext.html) object, similar to the one that `node --test` gives you when writing tests in JavaScript and with many of the same properties, plus the "world" where you can keep your state, and methods for attaching content.

### Finding your code

Discovery of your code is based on the following glob (relative to the working directory):

```
features/**/*.{cjs,js,mjs}
```

This isn't configurable ([yet](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-node/issues/10)).

## Reporters

Some Cucumber formatters are included as Node.js test reporters:

- HTML `--test-reporter=@cucumber/node/reporters/html --test-reporter-destination=./report.html`
- Message `--test-reporter=@cucumber/node/reporters/message --test-reporter-destination=./messages.ndjson`

## Limitations

It's early days, and there are some rough edges here, which we'll smooth out as soon as possible:

- **You can't mix Cucumber tests with other tests** so if you have non-Cucumber tests to run with `node --test`, you should do that in a separate run.
- **The `spec` reporter gets noisy if you also use a Cucumber reporter** because we're kind of abusing the `diagnostic` channel to send messages to the reporter. We'd recommend the `dot` reporter in the meantime.

There are also some pretty standard Cucumber features that are conspicuous by their absence (again, not for long):

- [Filtering by tag expression](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-node/issues/9)
- [BeforeAll/AfterAll hooks](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-node/issues/8)
- [Regular expression steps](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-node/issues/6)

## What's different?

Some behaviour differs from that of `cucumber-js` in meaningful ways.

### Arrow functions

`cucumber-node` doesn't set `this` to anything for the scope of your step/hook functions. Instead, a context object is passed as the first argument. This means there's no need to avoid arrow functions.

### Concurrency

`node --test` by default runs each test file in a separate process, and runs them concurrently as much as possible within the constraints of the system. This is different from `cucumber-js` which by default runs everything in-process and in serial.

The way work is divided up to run concurrently is also worth calling out. `node --test` does so at the file level, meaning many feature files can be executed concurrently, but scenarios within a feature file will always run in the defined order and in the same process. This is more predictable than `cucumber-js` which just makes a single pool of all scenarios and assigns them to worker processes as they become idle.
